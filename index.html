                    <strong>Alan Mathison Turing </strong> was an English mathematician,
                    computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was 
                    highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of 
                    algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
                    Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
